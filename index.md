Welcome to Ocean Dynamics at [NCSU](https://www.ncsu.edu/)

----------------


We are in the department of [Marine, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences](https://meas.sciences.ncsu.edu).
Our [group](Group/index.html) is interested in all aspects of modeling and observations of
ocean phenomena.

We are currently working on research problems related to:

- Western Boundary Current dynamics
- Mesoscale air-sea interaction and stochastic differential equations
- High-resolution climate modeling
- Submesoscale processes
- Observations using remote sensing and autonomous gliders/Saildrones
